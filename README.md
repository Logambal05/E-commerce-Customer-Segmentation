# E-commerce Customer Segmentation

## Abstract

E-commerce businesses face the challenge of understanding market trends to enhance their sales. This project employs the k-means clustering algorithm to group customers with similar interests based on the provided e-commerce dataset.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to utilize the k-means clustering algorithm to group customers with similar interests using the provided e-commerce dataset. The dataset includes information collected over time from a well-known e-commerce website, focusing on customer search profiles.

## Dataset Information

The data set includes variables such as Customer ID, Gender, Orders, and 35 features representing the number of times customers have searched for specific brands.

## Scope

### Problem Statement - K Means

- Analyzing existing customer data to gain valuable insights into purchase patterns.
- Data pre-processing, including missing value treatment.
- Segmenting customers based on the optimum number of clusters ('k') using silhouette score.


## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration and Pre-processing:**
    - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
    - Perform necessary data pre-processing steps, including handling missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Analyze the distribution of customer orders.
    - Explore gender distribution in the dataset.
    - Investigate the search patterns for the 35 brands.

3. **K-means Clustering:**
    - Determine the optimum number of clusters ('k') using silhouette score.
    - Apply k-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their activity.

4. **Insights and Interpretation:**
    - Interpret the clusters and provide insights into customer segments.
    - Analyze how variables are linked within each cluster.

5. **Conclusion:**
    - Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis.
